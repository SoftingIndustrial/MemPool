MemPool library
===============


The MemPool library is a stand-alone memory allocation library.
It is intended to either simulate low memory targets on windows
or linux, or to completely replace the system memory management.

It is based on the memory management code from the eCos operating
system, which was cut free from the environment so it can freely be
used on windows and linux.

It is re-published under the eCos licence.
